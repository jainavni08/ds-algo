two sum :target - num and use hashmap to find element , hashmap store with index

three sum :sort array , fixed i, two pointers one at last and one next to i . reduce 2nd pointer if sum < target and inc 1 pointer if sum > target.

max sum product : if neg max = (curr,min , min = min(curr,min) if pos max(curr,max)

sort0-1-2 : count no of zero and one . rewrite on given arrau zeros,one,twos

containsduplicate with k range : use hash set for fast checking ; also remove elemets once out of k range;
